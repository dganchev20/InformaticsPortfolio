            <h2 class="miami-info-heading">General Information</h2>

            <p> Miami, officially the City of Miami, is the seat of Miami-Dade County, and the cultural, economic
                and financial center of South Florida in the United States. The city covers an area of about 56
                square miles (150 km2) between the Everglades to the west and Biscayne Bay to the east. Miami is the
                sixth most densely populated major city in the United States with an estimated 2018 population of
                470,914. The Miami metropolitan area is home to 6.1 million people, the second-most populous in the
                southeastern United States and the seventh-largest in the nation. The city has the third tallest
                skyline in the U.S. with over 300 high-rises, 55 of which exceed 490 ft (149 m) .</p>

            <h2 class="miami-info-heading">What's so special?</h2>

            <p> Miami is a major center and leader in finance, commerce, culture, media, entertainment, the arts,
                and international trade. The metro area is by far the largest urban economy in Florida and the 12th
                largest in the United States, with a GDP of $344.9 billion as of 2017. In 2018, Miami was classified
                as an Alpha level global city by the GaWC. In 2019, Miami ranked seventh in the United States and
                31st among global cities in terms of business activity, human capital, information exchange,
                cultural experience, and political engagement. According to a 2018 UBS study of 77 world cities, the
                city was ranked as the third-richest in the United States and the eighth-richest in the world in
                terms of purchasing power. Miami is nicknamed the "Capital of Latin America" and is the largest city
                with a Cuban-American plurality.</p>
