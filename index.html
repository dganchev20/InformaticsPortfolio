                <h1> About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello, my name is Deyan. I am 12th grade at the American College of Sofia and this is my website. I
                    am interested in management, especially in the sports fields. In my spare time, I enjoy playing
                    football and volleyball, as well as researching information about historical events, finances, and
                    politics. I like watching documentaries and thrillers.
                </p>
                <h1> About Informatics </h1>
                <p>I thoroughly enjoyed the 12th grade informatics lessons since I gained significant knowledge and
                    experience in the field that, at least on a basic level, will always remain a helpful skill of mine.
                    The HTML and CSS problems were, at times, a little complicated and really challenged my
                    understanding and abilities, however, I still truly appreciate the course. I look forward to the
                    next semester.
                </p>
